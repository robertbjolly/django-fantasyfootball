# fantasyfootball
This is the first website I ever created using Django. The goal of the project is to have users create an account on my website and have the ability to create a fantasy football league where they would perform a live draft with their fellow fantasy football competitors.

Project Difficulties
As my first ever Django project, I had no experience with working with HTML, CSS, or a database. The learning curve for this project with no prior experience was very challenging. Day by day I learned SQL and the basics of HTML and CSS and was able to create my first ever website. The biggest challenge for me was understanding how to have two or more database tables to connect to one eachother to make my project as efficient and organized as possible. Their is a big learning curve when it comes to learning about a database and being able to implement using it on the backend of a website, and I am very proud that I was able to accomplish this with the Fantasy Football website.
